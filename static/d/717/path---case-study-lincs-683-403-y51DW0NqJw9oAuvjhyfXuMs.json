{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>Approach</h3>\n<h5>Streamlined platform for connecting and sharing</h5>\n<p>We transitioned the LINCS website hosting to secure Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud servers, then consolidated the overabundance of outdated websites LINCS had inherited from other departments.</p>\n<h5>Modern design that makes sense</h5>\n<p>We used U.S. Web Design Standards to make the new LINCS sites easy to navigate and mobile friendly. The streamlined design allows educators to quickly find the courses and resources they need.</p>\n<h5>Fast, friendly support</h5>\n<p>Our support team provides empathetic and knowledgeable resolution of technical and login issues, often much faster than users expect! Educators feel supported and can get back to work quickly.</p>\n<h5>User feedback guides our work</h5>\n<p>We tie the LINCS helpdesk into the agile process through daily communication between support staff and development teams. This ensures that system improvements are based on real user needs.</p>\n<h5>DevOps for efficient code</h5>\n<p>Our build, test, and release practices for LINCS emphasize a DevOps culture of communication and collaboration. We put systems in place for code standardization and stability.</p>\n<h5>Sharing code across agencies</h5>\n<p>We created a GitHub repo to share the code for LINCS courses so other agencies and educators can implement them. We also made over 50 commits on LINCS’ behalf to various projects on Drupal.org.</p>\n<blockquote>\nCras justo odio, dapibus ac facilisis in, egestas eget quam.

LINCS needed to be restructured with modern technical architecture into a secure, streamlined platform where education practitioners could enjoy learning and sharing. LINCS users also needed reliable, friendly support to resolve technical and login issues and get back to helping adult learners.","tags":["Support","Drupal","Quality Assurance"],"specs":["Drupal 7","JIRA Service Desk","Moodle Learning Management System","FedRAMP compliant platform","Mobile-friendly, responsive design","Shibboleth Single Sign On","Docker","Ansible"],"images":[{"caption":"Presenting findings from discovery about LINCS user needs","alt":"LINCS Home page","url":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/LINCS1-469ff5b1442001b7d8c01fd7449e406e-25c95.jpg"}}}},{"caption":"Visitors to the LINCS website can quickly find the resources they need","alt":"CivicActions meets with LINCS team and partners","url":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/LINCS2-a39956c2a0531be03e1501d6cc701b13-25c95.jpg"}}}}]}}},"pageContext":{}}
