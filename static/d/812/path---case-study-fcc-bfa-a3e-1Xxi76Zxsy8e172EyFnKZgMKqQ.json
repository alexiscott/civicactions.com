{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h3>Approach</h3>\n<h5>Bringing agile to government</h5>\n<p>We trained FCC in agile practices, communicating with the product owner and stakeholders throughout the project. Together we curated priorities, made sure the end result met real user needs, and helped the organization move away from traditional waterfall methodology.</p>\n<h5>Smooth content migration</h5>\n<p>We performed a massive content migration from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 and consolidated content from various legacy systems, with no disruption to FCC’s very active user community. </p>\n<h5>Designing for users</h5>\n<p>We made the site more consistent by organizing the information architecture and also improved the search feature so visitors can quickly navigate to the resources they need. The user experience of FCC.gov is now as intuitive as modern consumer sites.</p>\n<h5>Simplified content management</h5>\n<p>We added access control to allow FCC’s many content creators to manage their own content without compromising the integrity of the site’s design. We also helped make the creation of content more pleasant and efficient by adding a robust text editor.</p>\n<h5>Accessibility for all users</h5>\n<p>FCC serves users with all levels of ability and is itself responsible for the accessibility of 21st Century communications. We scanned the site for compliance issues and resolved them. The current website serves as a model for <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>\n<h5>Testing to ensure quality code</h5>\n<p>To make sure all new code worked properly, we used Behat, a behavior-driven development testing framework that is written in English and can double as user acceptance test criteria. Behat tests were configured to automatically run when new code was merged. </p>\n<h5>Turn-key solution for deployment</h5>\n<p>Due to security restrictions, we could not have full access to the production server, which made deployment of the new site complicated. We architected turn-key ways to deploy to production so the IT folks at FCC could do it themselves.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<cite>  </cite>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Impact</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>FCC learned agile methods and can carry the benefits into future projects </li>\n<li>Legacy content from various systems is successfully migrated into one modern platform </li>\n<li>The public has easier access to regulations and resources through a well-designed site</li>\n<li>FCC administrators save time and money with more efficient content management</li>\n<li>The new site is strong and stable as a result of quality assurance testing</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Explore</h3>\n<h5>See our work</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://FCC.gov\">https://FCC.gov</a></p>\n<h5>From the client’s perspective</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2015/04/20/modernizing-fccgov-website\">Modernizing the FCC.gov Website </a></p>\n<h5>Contributions to the Drupal community</h5>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/hook_update_deploy_tools\">Hook Update Deploy Tools</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/migration_tools\">Migration Tools</a></p>\n<figure>\n  <div> \n    <header>69,706 </header>\n    <p>pieces of <br>migrated content<p>\n  </div>\n  <div> \n      <header>19</header>\n      <p>bureaus and offices <br>housed within FCC<p>\n  </div>\n</figure>","frontmatter":{"path":"/case-study/FCC","title":"Modernizing a legacy federal system","client_name":"Federal Communications Commission","project":"LINCS","website":"https://www.FCC.gov","background_section_title":"Cumbersome, outdated federal website","background_section":"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) relies on its website to provide regulatory guidance to millions of visitors each year across various industries.
